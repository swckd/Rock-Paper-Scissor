## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I have built out this Rock, Paper, Scissors Game from a Figma file.

I have used HTML 5, SASS and Javascript, all in Bootstrap 5.

Your should be able to:

- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
