Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors web application! This project brings the classic game to your browser, allowing you to challenge the computer in a battle of wits.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the web pages is defined using HTML5, as indicated by the `index.html` file.
- **CSS**: The styling of the web pages is done using CSS, as indicated by the `styles/style.css` file.
- **JavaScript**: The functionality of the game is implemented using JavaScript, primarily in the `script.js` file.

## Key Code Components

In the `script.js` file, you'll find several interesting pieces of code:

- **delay function**: An asynchronous function that pauses execution for a specified amount of time. This is likely used to create a delay in the game, such as when waiting for the computer's move.
- **computerSelects function**: An asynchronous function that randomly selects a move for the computer.
- **playAgain function**: Resets the game state, allowing the player to start a new game.
- **toggleThirdScreen function**: Toggles the visibility of the third screen, likely used to switch between different views in the game.

## Gameplay

The game logic is event-driven, with event listeners set up on the buttons for the player's move selection. The game state is managed using several variables, such as `playerSelection` and `computerSelection`.

## Continous improvements

In the future I want to add more smooth effects to transitions.
